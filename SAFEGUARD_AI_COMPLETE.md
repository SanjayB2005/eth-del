## üìã Usage Examples

### **Immediate Safety Scenario**

```
User: "My ex is stalking me online and threatening me"

AI Response:
"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Online stalking is a serious crime. Here's what to do immediately:

**Urgent Steps:**
1. Do NOT engage with the stalker - block on all platforms
2. Screenshot all evidence (threats, messages, profiles)
3. Contact police - file a harassment/stalking report
4. Consider a restraining order

**Legal Protection:**
- Most states have cyberstalking laws with serious penalties
- Document everything with dates/times
- Save evidence in multiple secure locations

**Secure Documentation:**
I can help you create a tamper-proof record of this incident using blockchain technology for legal purposes.

Would you like me to start secure evidence logging, or do you need emergency contact information?"
```

### **Evidence Documentation**

```
User: "Create a secure record of my harassment case"

AI Action: {"action":"create_topic","parameters":{"topicName":"Harassment_Case_Evidence_Log"}}

Result: ‚úÖ Topic 0.0.6916366 created - Secure evidence logging active
